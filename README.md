You can make your Email ID public just by going into ```settings->Emails->Keep my email addresses private``` and Uncheck the Keep my email addresses private option.

## Lets see how I made this Action
<br>

## 1. First of all Setup an Email Sending Account

1. I Created a new gmail account for sending the emails to the Contributors.
2. Then you have to authorize Gmail to send the automated emails via this https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps

3. And in the end create a [Github Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) Called `GKEY` and add your gmail password to it.
<br>

## 2. Setting up the action in your Repository

1. Make sure that your repository contains all the necessary files which are present in this repository.
2. Click on the Actions tab and then `create an action`.

3. Add code in `Admire.yml` to your workflow `yml` file.
<br>

## 3. Modify Email Contents 

 - You just have to Replace the `sender_mailID` in `AdmireME.py` file with your newly created `email address`
 - And then replace the `msg['From']` with your email name.
 - that's it!!!!
