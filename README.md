## Lets see how I made this Action

2. Authorize Gmail to send automated emails via this tool https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps

3. And in the end create a [Github Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) Called `GKEY` and add your gmail password to it.

## 2. Setting up the action

1. Make sure that your repository contains all the necessary files which are present in this repository.
2. Click on Actions and `create an action`.
